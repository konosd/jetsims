# Polymer simulations for Jets

This repository contains the scripts used to produce the simulations presented in the preprint by (Ya et al., 2022).
The simulations are based on the polychrom software (Version v0.1.0, 10.5281/zenodo.3579473, Imakaev et al., 2019), 
and scripts were adapted for our purposes from the open source code of polychrom found at [https://github.com/open2c/polychrom](https://github.com/open2c/polychrom).

Information on how to run the simulations are included in every subdirectory with the different cases, under '''runs.txt'''

Simulations are run on a NVIDIA GPU-equipped workstation, and minor adjustments will be needed for computation on non-cuda machines.
